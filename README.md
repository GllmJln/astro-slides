# Astro Unveiled: Navigating the Stars of Modern Web Development

Some slides about Astro written in Astro.

I mostly wanted to see if I could leverage Astro to write slides in a way that wasn't too terrible. Some dodgy CSS and some wonky JS later, they are here.

These slides will also be used for a talk.
