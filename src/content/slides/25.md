- Sharing state between islands can be tricky. `Svelte` built-in stores still work. A lot of other stores don't. Astro recommends using the `Nano Stores` library.

- Requires the use and knowledge of two or more different frameworks
  - A caveat to this is that using another framework is a choice. You can go quite far with plain JavaScript, especially if it's nicely encapsulated inside components.
