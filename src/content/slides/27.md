align: flex-start

You may have noticed these slides were written using Astro. This was done leveraging:

- Content collections, each slide is a markdown file (28 files)
- View transitions
- 5 `.astro` files, 1 page, 3 layouts, 1 component
- Additional 4 components for showing output of some code examples
- 9 images
- Some dodgy CSS
- 30ish lines of JavaScript
