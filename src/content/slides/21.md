Let's add `Svelte` by running

```bash
npx astro add svelte
```

Why Astro and Svelte?

- Similar philosophies on speed and lightness
- Similar enough file structure and syntax to avoid too much context-switching

> Svelte is a lightweight JavaScript framework that compiles code to JavaScript that runs natively in the browser. It aims to feel similar enough to standard HTML + JS + CSS, focusing on ease of use, simplicity and performance.
