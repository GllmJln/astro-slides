- Astro lets you use as many different UI frameworks as you wish for your project

- Can have different frameworks on different pages, or different frameworks rendering on same page

- Although this is discouraged in general, it may make it easier for teams used to different frameworks to work on one codebase

- Could make migrations from a Astro + X project to a Astro + Y project easier
