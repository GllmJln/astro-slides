If you really want to blow up the size of your `node_modules`, Astro lets you use as many different UI frameworks as you wish for your project.

<!-- There is nothing stopping you from writing one page with React components and another page with Vue. There is also nothing stopping you from having a single page with a Svelte component, a React Component and a Alpine.js component. -->

Although this is discouraged in general, it may make it easier for teams used to different frameworks to work on one codebase.

An additional benefit, could be that it would make migrations from a Astro + X project to a Astro + Y project easier, by enabling an incremental transition between frameworks.
