Astro and many of the recent web frameworks, are constantly pushing current technology to improve performance and developer experience.

An increase in performance has shown to increase sales, sign-up and retention. The prevalence of mobile devices has seen a larger proportion of compute to move back from the client to the server.

One of the reasons compute shifted to the client in the first place was to increase interactivity of webpages.

Astro aims to tackle the problem by constraining interactivity to only the parts of the application that need it.
