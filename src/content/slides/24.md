There are multiple client directives to control how the component is rendered

- `client:load` starts importing component on page load. Used for components that must be rendered immediately

- `client:idle` starts loading and hydrating once the page has done an initial render

- `client:visible` start loading and hydrating once the component comes into view. An offset (in pixels) can also be defined
