Let's add `Svelte` by running

```bash
npx astro add svelte
```

Why Astro and Svelte?

- Similar philosophies on speed and lightness
- Similar enough file structure and syntax to avoid too much context-switching

> Svelte is a lightweight JavaScript framework that compiles code to JavaScript that runs natively in the browser. It aims to feel similar enough to vanilla HTML, focusing on ease of use, simplicity and performance.
